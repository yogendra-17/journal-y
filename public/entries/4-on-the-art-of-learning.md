There's a trap I keep falling into: watching tutorial after tutorial, feeling productive, but not actually building anything.

I've started following a new rule: for every hour of learning, spend two hours applying. Read about a concept, then immediately try to break it. Build something small. Write about what confused you.

The Feynman technique works: if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. That's why this journal exists.

Every entry forces me to articulate what I've learned, and the gaps become painfully obvious.
